# Palworld_Scripts
Scripts to manage Palworld dedicated servers

Currently only a "watchdog" script that requires a specific version of python's RCON, since palworld is dumb and doesn't return stuff correctly right now:
https://github.com/conqp/rcon/pull/26

Watchdog script also only sends notifications when players join/leave the server. Customize via the first lines in the script.
